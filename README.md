# Netflix Stock Analysis - Web Scraping & EDA Prject

## Project summary
This project was initiated by Katsuhiko Maeda (me) and my desire to find out Netflix's current business position in comparison to the past decade and how the investors reacted to the recent drop in its stock price. I have conducted research to answer those questions by using Netflix's stock price as an indicator of the company's performance and future earning potential. This project contains instructions on web scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Netflix's stock quotes.
