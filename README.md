# Netflix Stock Analysis - Web Scraping & EDA Prject

## Project summary
This project was initiated by Katsuhiko Maeda (me) and my desire to find out Netflix's current business position in comparison to the past decade and how the investors reacted to the recent price drop. I decided to use stock price as an indicator of Netflix's performance and future earning potential.
