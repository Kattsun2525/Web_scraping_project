# Netflix Stock Analysis - Web Scraping & EDA Prject

## Project summary
This project was initiated by Katsuhiko Maeda (myself) and my desire to find out Netflix's current business position in comparison to the past decade and how the investors reacted to the recent drop in its stock price. I have conducted research to answer those questions by using Netflix's stock price as an indicator of the company's performance and future earning potential. This project contains instructions on web scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Netflix's stock quotes. 

## Written instructions and files for this project
In this repository, you will find the python code and the data files I used for scpraping Netflix stock quotes on Yahoo Finance and conducting Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). The dataset in this repository contains Netflix's stock quotes in the past 10 years and consists of the following variables.
* Open: The price of the stock when the market opened
* High: Highest stock price traded during that day
* Low: Lowest stock price traded on that day
* Close: The price of the stock when the market closed
* Volume: The total amount of stocks traded on that day
* Date (index column) : Stock trade date from October 22th in 2012 to October 17th in 2022.
